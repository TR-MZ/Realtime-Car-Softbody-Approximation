# Realtime-Car-Softbody-Approximation [READ THIS: RELEASING SOON]

TR-MZ's realtime car softbody approximation for Roblox.

This is an open-source(ish) system I've developed for realistic vehicle deformation — think crashes, denting, and jiggle physics that runs performant even on mobile.

**Release plan**: I'll make the full repo public (with clean code, how it works, examples, and usage docs) once we hit **100 stars** ⭐  
Share with friends, Roblox dev groups, or your Discord — ask them to **star** + **watch** if they want this unlocked and turned into something everyone can build on!
